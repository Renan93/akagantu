Children’s Place gives caring supportive early intervention to improve life for the children of Aiken County.<br><br>

<span class="name1">AGENCY PHILOSOPHY</span><br><br>

The staff and faculty of Children’s Place believe the early formative years of childhood are crucial to optimum development. We respect each and every child as a unique and dynamic person and we strive to foster and sustain emotional, social, intellectual, personal, physical and creative growth simultaneously. To promote such growth, we strive to maintain a program that is child-centered and experienced based.<br><br>

We recognize that the family is the constant in a child’s life and as their children’s first teacher they need to be honored and respected for their culture, beliefs, strengths, and individualized ways of coping. We believe that we must be flexible, culturally aware, and responsive to the individual family’s needs for both support and education. We design our work with families to focus on the needs of the child, the needs of the parent, and on the parent-child relationship. We believe that supporting families can include home visitation, family or individual therapy and education.<br><br>

We also believe that an early childhood curriculum should allow each child to:<br><br>

Children's Place, Inc has its roots in many organizations formed during the 1950’s and 60’s in grassroots efforts to help low income working parents and their families. The two primary organizations were the Community Christian Child Care Center formed in 1951 and the Services Council of Aiken County formed in 1961. The Community Christian Child Care Center began when Mrs. Mary Price recognized the need to have childcare for low income working mothers to prevent older children from dropping out of school.  This center operated from the St. Augustine’s site until 1970 when it merged with the Services Council of Aiken County and moved to the current site, the Immanuel Presbyterian Church built in 1886, at 310 Barnwell Ave, NE. The Services Council of Aiken County was the outgrowth of work by the YWCA, which had also begun in 1951 with the beginning of the Savannah River Plant.<br><br>

The Services Council of Aiken County began in 1961 as the last major contribution by the YWCA as that organization collapsed over the integration issue. The Council operated out of a four-room residence until it moved to the Immanuel Presbyterian Church. It provided programs or both young and old, with a mission of providing recreational, intellectual, and moral development for children, youth, and adults. Their pledge was to serve our communities better by developing citizens of today and tomorrow through programs of growth in spirit, in heart, in mind, and in body. Out of YWCA organization came both the Services Council and Mrs. Josie Smith Hazel. Mrs. Hazel was a social worker and the first director of the Services Council. She stayed in that position for over 10 years. During her tenure she helped to form many service organizations including the Croft House, the Red Cross, and the Aiken Area Council on Aging, the Salvation Army, Vocational Rehabilitation and Smith-Hazel Recreation Center. She was a volunteer youth leader and in 1976, named Women of the Year by the Aiken Chamber of Commerce.
